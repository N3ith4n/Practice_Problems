#Prog30: Create a program that ask user to input a number, continue asking until the user input is invalid. Display the average.

#makes an empty list where the numbers will be placed, this will be used as the basis of the loop and assigning a variable
numbers = []

#Initializes a variable to be used for solving the average later
total_number = 0


#makes a loop that will continue to ask the user a number until the inputted value is not a number and also adds 1 to a variable that will be used for the average later

#adds all the numbers inside the list

#gets the average

#prints the average
