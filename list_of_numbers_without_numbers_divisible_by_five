#Prog19: Create a program that print all the numbers starting from 0 to 100 except numbers ending in zero or ending five.
 
#makes an empty list where all numbers from 0 to 100 will be placed

#makes a loop that appends(inputs) numbers 0 to 100 to the empty list

#makes another empty list where all numbers divisible by five(ending in zero or five) will be placed

#makes another loop that detects which numbers are divisible by five and appends them to the second list

#prints the second list
