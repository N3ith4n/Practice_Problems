#Prog10: Create a program that print all the numbers starting from 0 to 100 except numbers ending in zero.
 
#makes an empty list where all numbers from 0 to 100 will be placed
 
#makes a loop that appends(inputs) numbers 0 to 100 to the empty list

#makes another empty list where all numbers without 0 will be placed

#makes another loop that detects which numbers have zero and appends them to the second list

#prints the second list
